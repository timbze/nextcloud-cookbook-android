**First steps**

After installation you must go into the settings view and select the recipe directory with the recipes inside.
You find it on your storage under _Android/media/com.nextcloud.client/nextcloud/&lt;your account&gt;/&lt;folder&gt;_.

You also can choose the theme in the settings.

After that, the start view has a list of recipes and you select a recipe to view the details.
